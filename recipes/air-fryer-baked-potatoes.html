    <h3>Description</h3>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>4 large baking potatoes, scrubbed</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
        <li>kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon garlic powder, or to taste</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon dried parsley, or to taste</li>
        <li>4 tablespoons butter</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat an air fryer to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Rub potatoes with olive oil and season with salt, pepper, 
            garlic powder, and parsley. Place potatoes in the air fryer 
            basket.</li>
        <li>Cook in the preheated air fryer until potatoes are soft, 
            40 to 50 minutes, depending on potato size.</li>
        <li>Slice potatoes lengthwise. Pinch both sides of each potato, 
            using your hands and forcing potatoes to open, until the 
            fluffy insides start to come out. Add 1 tablespoon of butter 
            into each potato.</li>
    </ol>
